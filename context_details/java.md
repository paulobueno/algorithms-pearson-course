# Java

## Q: What is the main risk of compiling a library from source locally instead of using a pre-compiled JAR?

**A:** The main risk of compiling a library locally is that you have to have the proper environment to compile the code, such as defining the right Java's version. On the other hand, when using a compiled JAR file, it already passed from the right process and is ready to be consumed (E.g. Maven downloads remote libraries as ready to be consumed, what means that they are already compiled)
